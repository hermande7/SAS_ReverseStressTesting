Stress scenario selection by empirical likelihood
One of the recent paper on reverse stress testing and empirical likelihood is the one published by Glasserman et al. in July 2014 – hyperlinks below:

We will follow Glasserman paper to go step by step from data acquisition to reverse stress test scenario selection by empirical likelihood. Here below is the brief overview of the different steps:
Step 1 – Data acquisition of the input risk factors (historical data loading of the 6 equity indices mentioned in the Example 1 above).
Step 2 – Individual risk factors returns computation and corresponding portfolio return computation using the equation (1) above.
Step 3 – Definition of the portfolio loss threshold above which we consider the losses as ‘extreme’.
Step 4 – Computation of the conditional mean of the ‘extreme’ losses.
Step 5 – From conditional mean to most likely loss scenario.
Step 6 – Computation of the empirical likelihood confidence interval around the conditional mean of the extreme losses and around the most likely extreme loss scenario.
Step 7 – Combined graph of the steps 2-6.
